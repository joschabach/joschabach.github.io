What is going on with feminism today? The German twittersphere is currently abuzz with controversy about [erzaehlmirnix](https://erzaehlmirnix.wordpress.com/), a (female) blogger and cartoonist that refuses to identify with any particular political camp, and instead describes, analyzes and caricatures the world from her own personal vantage point. Some of her observations reflect critically on the denigration of women and on racism, so her cartoons are sometimes passed around into the social media timelines of feminists and intersectional anti-racists, where they invariably give rise to angry outbursts, vicious hostility, waves of mass blockings and defriendings. Why? Some of erzaehlmirnix' cartoons make fun of feminist tropes and occasionally even attract applause from mens' rights activists, which makes her a thoroughly "anti-feminist, sexist, racist person" in the eyes of some feminists, requiring utter and complete ostracism even in instances where she is supporting positions that these feminists hold themselves. This seems to be puzzling to many outside observers, because _all_ of her cartoons seem to fall within the scope of a thoroughly liberal, anti-racist, critical world-view. Here is an especially flagrant example that has been passed around as evidence for her irredeemably "sexist", and "masculist" (anti-feminist) views.

It seems clear what is going on here: The cartoon satirizes an altercation, possibly between the author and her husband, with a slightly exaggerated, angry depiction of a feminist position, namely, that the mood swings caused by PMS are often used to stereotype women as irrational, and ultimately unsuitable for holding positions in society that require rationality and emotional stability. Her (slightly frightened) male counterpart points out that her anger happens to be correlated with her current hormonal disposition, which she implicitly admits by becoming even more angry. In my view, the cartoon captures a lucid reflection on how much the author's perception of the world varies with moods that are induced by hormonal processes, expresses a degree of exasperation about this, and thus demonstrates her competence in recognizing and dealing with these influences in real-life situations. The humorous effect of the cartoon stems from its self-referential nature (it is a PMS joke that purports that PMS jokes are impermissible).

What makes this evidence of erzaehlmirnix' rabid and irredeemable anti-feminism? Of course, we can identify a context in which the message of the cartoon would indeed support a discriminatory message. The notion that the side effects of menstruation renders the female mind too unstable to allow women to run for public offices has been used as an argument against suffragettes and against allowing women to obtain drivers licenses in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and _could in principle_ be used to argue against women in positions of leadership, decision-making or rational analysis in companies or science. However, insinuating that this context could be applied to this cartoon is ridiculous: its author is a psychologist with a PhD, very likely holds a drivers license, votes in elections, and lives in a country governed by a female chancellor famous for an absence of visible mood swings or passions. Besides, the male counterpart in the cartoon is clearly not dominant, or successfully trying to establish some kind of superiority.

I guess that the objections have a more subtle source: the cartoon acknowledges a difference between men and women that does not result from social or cultural constructs. It does not draw immediate conclusions with respect to suitability of women for arbitrary positions in society (which would have to be subject to additional empirical inquiry, to which, thanks to Angela Merkel and many others, we already know the answer), and it does not refer to an emotional reality that is alien to menstruating feminists, but this is not necessary. It suffices that it could in principle be used to support a world view that sees woman as inferior, regardless of its actual context and its factual accuracy. Erzaehlmirnix leaves room for the construction of a reality in which women are inferior to men.

I have been following the strifes between different brands of feminism (and more generally, social activism) in the American and German blogosphere with puzzlement for quite some time. I can understand that social media attacks are launched at political enemies, and indeed, feminists get constantly attacked, vilified and threatened by misandrists. But how is it possible that the majority of the struggles seem to involve people that purport to fight for the same political goals? Much smarter people than me have asked the same question, and suggested that the [construction of viciously hated outgroups requires a high degree of similarity](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). That is a compelling observation, but does not explain the asymmetry of the social media wars: within the feminist and social justice spectrum, there seems to be a very loosely knit community of individuals that share goals and a willingness to engage in rational discourse, and a much more tightly knit community of individuals that share identities, routinely use abusive tactics, manipulation and verbal violence, and display a willingness to isolate themselves from dissent. These self-immunizing strategies involve


- identity arguments (only individuals with the right gender, social background, skin pigmentation can have experience and therefore valid opinions), 
- anti-identity arguments (an argument is invalid because of the wrong gender, social background, skin pigmentation of the person who makes it),
- truth presupposition (accusers of oppression are automatically victims, and questioning a victim's account amounts to oppression), 
- attack on civilized discourse rules ("anger is political", "tone policing"),
- framing of discourse to only allow consenting opinions ("derailing"),
- ignorance of arguments of moderate dissenters, instead conflating all opposition with violent and abusive anti-feminists

What constitutes the difference between the identity based community and the rest? It is tempting to think that it is either comprised of individuals that are more prone to [logical fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) than others (i.e. colloquially: they are stupid), but many of the leading voices are clearly highly intelligent and very well educated. One could also suspect that they lack basic integrity, that is, they harbor scam artists that only pretend to serve social goals, while attempting to gain personal advancement, speaker positions etc., and indeed, a social movement that immunizes itself against criticism provides a fertile hunting ground for such individuals (colloquially: they are evil). On the other hand, most of the activists within this group appear to be entirely sincere.

I suspect that something else is going on: We are witnessing a transition of leftist activism from a foundation in economical theories (mostly Marxism) to [social constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism). Most of traditional feminism addressed two fronts: legal inequality, i.e. the different legal status of people based on their genitals or skin pigmentation, and economic inequality. In Western countries, most of the legal inequalities except for the injustices of citizenship have by now been resolved, and individual freedom is largely a function of access to economic resources. For those that do not already live in palaces, access to sustenance, education, culture, self-actualization and recreation largely depends on the terms to which they have to sell their labor, which reduces the chances of women, especially since they are disproportionally involved in but not paid for raising children. In addition to that, women, sexual and ethnic minorities are also discriminated against based on unfair stereotypes, but this should be automatically rectified in a free labor market, because companies that hire undervalued employees will gain an obvious advantage, and today, members of all of these groups routinely rise to the highest ranks of politics and celebrity. 

In traditional liberal interpretations of the world, differences in individual freedom will have to be resolved by counteracting economic inequality, for instance by offering better child support, free education, creating public infrastructure, redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor, ending the colonial exploitation of the developing world, and tearing down some of the palaces to build better huts. In this view, differences of gender, sexuality, innate abilities and skin color are minor issues, and won't matter if everybody has the economic means to self-actualize. 

The current social movements are interpreting the world in a fundamentally different way: To them, social reality is not the result of economic facts, but reality is seen as a social construct. Gender differences are social constructs. Income differences between genders are not caused by innate differences in economic exploitability, but by an unfair construction of gender identities. In this view, evolutionary psychologists and cognitive scientists that report innate gender differences do not report relevant facts, but attempt to perpetuate a faulty social construction which leads to an unjust world, and therefore need to be opposed. The wealth and freedom differences caused by neocolonial exploitation, colonial history and resulting lack of access to education and acquisition of participatory skills are now explained by the construction of the colonized identity of the Person of Color. Power differentials between those that live in palaces and those that live in huts do not result from the fact that those in the palaces have access to wealth, but from differences in the identity construction of the palace inhabitants (which often turn out to be white, heterosexual males), which need to be addressed by changing their construction of identity (checking their privilege), and introducing palace dwelling quotas for members of the underprivileged identities. 

If reality is a social construct, then those that want to change it for the better cannot afford to engage in discursive niceties, such as admitting that the message of erzaehlmirnix' cartoons may be factually correct, or that her errors are well-intentioned. According to social constructionism, reality is not some "objectionable truth waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry." Rather, there can be "multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy." The fight for social justice requires us to make the right reality true and legitimate, and erzaehlmirnix' alternate depiction of reality makes her a clear opponent.

Thus, 3rd wave feminism, or "Social Justice" feminism, is not the result of some weird in-group construction, of intellectual shortcomings or insincere intentions. Its discursive strategies and judgments are entirely logical and meaningful–if one accepts the radical idea that reality is a social construct. But this also makes social constructionist activism a very risky project: if its basic foundational premise is wrong, it may turn out that its strategies instigate new kinds of oppression and even sabotage liberal activism, without resulting in actual progress on its social goals. And if one already presupposes that reality is a social construct, then it becomes impossible to verify the viability of that premise, because any investigation that proves it wrong must be an act of faulty social construction.
